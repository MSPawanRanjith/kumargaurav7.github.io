						<p>WIE Symposium is a trademark event of IEEE RIT Student Branch WIE Affinity Group. It is held annually on the occasion of International Women's Day to celebrate the achievements made by the eminent women of our society and to inspire the young ladies to dream big, fly high and leave their mark in every field. Over 1000 students and faculties took part in the event which took place on 8th-9th of March, 2017.</p>
						<p>The main objective of the events held under WIE Symposium is provide opportunities for women engineering students to develop and showcase leadership skills that can be nurtured in future to their full potential.</p>
						<p>The two-days symposium was inaugurated by Dr. Geetha Kannan, Managing Director,Anita Borg Institute. Dr. Geetha in her key note address spoke on “Leadership Powers Innovation: Women in Technology Driving the Innovation Our World Needs” to a packed audience. The first day also saw speakers from various walks of life who achieved success despite all odds. We had with us Smt.Nalini Shekar, a social activist and entrepreneur, who co-founded “Hasiru Dala” (Green Force), Bangalore, addressing the issue related to marginalised waste pickers. She shared with us some insights into the future where the rag pickers become experienced entrepreneurs, building bio-gas generators and dry waste is collected in every corner of Bangalore.</p>
						<p>Of the dignitaries, we had with us the very energetic Dr.Jharna Majumdar, Dean R&amp;D, Prof. Computer Science &amp; Engineering at Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, Bangalore. She enlightened the students about the various projects she had undertaken and offered them an opportunity to work with her in her on-going projects.</p>
						<p>Mrs.Vasanti Kumari, currently serving as the mission director at ISRO, shared her vast experience of 33 years at ISRO. She spoke about the future scopes in aerospace engineering and motivated the students to pursue a career in it.</p>
						<p>The session next saw with us Ms.M.S.Radhika Radhakrishnan, Computer Science graduate who quit job in IT to advocate for women's and LGBT rights. With a very interactive session, Ms Radhika motivated the students to guide them towards Gender equality and safety and liberal rights of women. Mr. Ramani Venkat, NPL trainer and motivational speaker, covered the topics of Empowering, Innovation and leadership qualities, awakening the heroes within each of the participants.</p>
						<p>Apart from these, various student competitions and activities were conducted to encourage them to bring out the best in them. Events like Idea presentation (Make in India) saw the young innovators come up with plethora of ideas to make the world an even better place. 'Treasure to Trash' was another event which allowed the avid students to recycle the wastes around into useful products. Cultural events brought an end to the two-days Women's Day Celebration on an energetic note.</p>
