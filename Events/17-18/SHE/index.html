					<h4><b>About the event</b></h4>
					<p>Until a couple of decades ago, women in India used scrap cloth from old saris or towels during their menstruation. In a country where the bodily function of menstruation was and still is a taboo subject, with the accompanying  shame, stigma and myths surrounding it, many women still reuse pieces of old cloth.
						Disposable sanitary napkins are being proposed as a solution to this. While there is no debate that women and girls need to be provided alternatives to the old methods which made them highly susceptible to infection, the solution of disposable sanitary napkins, is creating a whole slew of new problems in a country like ours with a large population and poor waste disposal systems.
						Luckily there are solutions which are ecologically safe, affordable and safe for a woman's body. These are the menstrual cup and the washable cloth pads and these are available in India. Women who have made the switch to cups or cloth pads are happy, because of the benefits (no rash, itching), the economics (recover costs in less than 1 year) and the convenience. Unfortunately these options are not advertised and awareness about them is very low.
						Our campaign called ‘Green the Red’ is a small effort to fill this gap of information. We conduct awareness sessions, talks in Corporates, Anganwdis, Government Departments, NGOs and set up outreach tables at women oriented events such as the Pinkathons, Contours Women's Day runs, BBMP Compost Santhes and Swacha Graha. We have collaborated with NGOs who work with adolescent girls to take our message to the high schools. All this has given our fledgling campaign small 'wings'.  We aim to engage with the government and influence changes at policy level for promotion of sustainable menstrual hygiene options only.</p>
